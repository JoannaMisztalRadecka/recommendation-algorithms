# Recommendation Algorithms Lab

In this lab, we will implement different recommendation algorithms and evaluate their performance on a movie rating prediction task.

**Task 1:** First, we will build a simple item-item kNN recommendation algorithm with different item feature representations using `scikit-learn` module. We will vvisualize the item vectors on 2D plot.

**Task 2:** Next, we will compare the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms for different hyperparametes setting on a standard movie ratings dataset. 

**Setup:**
1. Install Anaconda package for your system
2. Install `surprise` Python package with  Conda: `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise` (Conda works best with Windows, you may use `pip` on other OS according to instructions http://surpriselib.com/
3. Install visualization packages with pip (or conda): `pip install seaborn plotly umap-learn`
3. Start Jupyter Notebook and open `Recommendation Algorithms.ipynb` notebook
